1. The project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms, particularly Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor, for the detection of credit card fraud. These algorithms have been found to be effective in identifying anomalies within credit card transactions, thereby enhancing fraud detection capabilities.


2. The utilization of Isolation Forests for outlier detection is a core component of the project. This technique relies on random feature and split selection for identifying anomalous patterns within the credit card transaction data, which contributes to the overall accuracy of fraud detection.
   

3. Anomaly scores are a key aspect of the Isolation algorithm, forming the basis for identifying potential fraudulent activities within credit card transactions. The project delves into the nuances of anomaly scoring and its role in enhancing the precision of fraud detection processes.


Data Set 

The project acknowledges the challenge posed by imbalanced datasets, recognizing that it can impact the accuracy of outlier detection. Efforts are directed towards addressing this issue to ensure the robustness of the fraud detection system, particularly in handling smaller datasets.
